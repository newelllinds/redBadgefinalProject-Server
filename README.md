Indy Art App is designed to support local artists. Role based access allows for different functionality for artists vs supporters. Local artists can create Artist Profiles as well as an online Shop to display their work. Artists can edit and delete their profiles and shop listings. Supporters can view Artist Profiles and Artist Shop Listings.
